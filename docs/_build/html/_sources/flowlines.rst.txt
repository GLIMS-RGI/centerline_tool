Glacier flowlines
=================

OGGM's default model is a "flowline model", which means that the glacier ice flow is
assumed to happen along a representative "1.5D" flowline, as in the image
below. "1.5D" here is used to emphasize that although glacier ice can flow
only in one direction along the flowline, each point of the glacier has
a geometrical width. This width means that flowline glaciers are able to match
the observed area-elevation distribution of true glaciers, and can parametrize
the changes in glacier width with thickness changes.

Geometrical centerlines
-----------------------

Centerline determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our algorithm is an implementation of the procedure described by
`Kienholz et al., (2014)`_. Apart from some minor changes (mostly the choice
of some parameters), we stay close to the original algorithm.

.. _Kienholz et al., (2014): http://www.the-cryosphere.net/8/503/2014/


The basic idea is to find the terminus of the glacier (its lowest point) and
a series of centerline "heads" (local elevation maxima). The centerlines are then
computed with a least cost routing algorithm minimizing both (i) the total
elevation gain and (ii) the distance to the glacier terminus.

The glacier has a major centerline (the longest one), and
tributary branches (in this case: two). The Hintereisferner glacier is a
good example of a wrongly outlined glacier: the two northern glacier sub-catchments
should have been classified as independent entities since they do not flow
to the main flowline (more on this below).

At this stage, the centerlines are still not fully suitable
for modelling. Therefore, a rather simple
procedure converts them to "flowlines", which
now have a regular grid spacing (which they will
keep for the rest of the workflow). The tail of the tributaries are cut
of before reaching the flowline they are tributing to:

This step is needed to better represent glacier widths at flowline junctions.
The empty circles on the main flowline indicate the location where the respective
tributaries are connected (i.e. where the ice flux that is originating from the
tributary will be added to the main flux when running the model dynamic).

Pros and cons of both methods
-----------------------------

Flowline representation of the glacier is **always** a simplification!

Geometrical centerlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pros:

  - Closer to the "true" length of the glacier.
  - Grid points along the centerlines preserve their geometrical information,
    i.e. one can compute the exact location of ice thickness change.
  - It is possible to have different model parameters for each flowline (e.g.
    different mass-balance models), although this is coming with its own
    challenges.
  - Arguably: better suitability for mass-balance parameterizations taking
    glacier geometry and exposition into account.
  - Arguably: better representation of the main glacier flow?

- Cons:

  - Complex and error prone: considerably more code than the elevation band
    flowlines.
  - Less robust: more glaciers are failing in the preprocessing than with
    the simpler method.
    When glaciers are badly outlined (or worse, when ice caps are not
    properly divided), or with bad DEMs, the geometrical flowline
    can "look" very ugly.
  - Computationally expensive (more grid points on average, more prone
    to numerical instabilities).
  - Complex handling of mass-balance parameters for tributaries at the
    inversion (leading to multiple temperature sensitivity parameters
    for large glaciers).
  - Related: **all "new generation" mass-balance models in OGGM currently
    handle only a single flowline because of this complexity.**

.. admonition:: **Summary**

   **When to use:** when geometry matters, and when length is a important variable.
   For mountain glaciers (e.g. Alps, Himalayas). With the old mass-balance
   model.

   **When not to use:** for ice caps, badly outlined glaciers, very large and
   flat glaciers, for global applications where geometrical details matters less.
   With the more fancy mass-balance models.
