Introduction
============

The glacier_centerlines project is a spin-off that comes from OGGM glacier evolution model. We have taken most of the code from the original OGGM functions and workflow. Its main purpose is to compute the glacier central flowlines given a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a glacier outline in a georefferenced format.

**Motivation**
Due to the increasing complexity of OGGM, it has been convenient to separate the determination of the glacier centerlines from the main model. Therefore users can obtain the glacier flowlines using the same methodology as in OGGM, with a code that is thought to serve this only purpose.
